[LINUX]
g++ gpki.cpp -o gpki -lsqlite3
[WINDOWS]
It requires x64windev package which contains g++ (its portable so can be downloaded and removed)
sqlite3 amalmagation and sqlite3.dll to be able to compile and run the program

g++ -W sqlite3.dll -include sqlite3.h gpki.cpp -o gpki.exe

note: this requires sqlite3.dll to be present in C:\Windows\System32 so that it is detected during runtime (gotta make it self contained)
or point to a different location e.g $env:localappdata\gpki
